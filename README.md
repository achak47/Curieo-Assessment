# Curieo-Assessment
This contains the online assessment by curieo , the problem statement is to create an error log 

I have used two maps for storing the error logs , both of these maps have a key as the log type of the error 

Time complexity : 
for Before operations --> O(log N)
for After Operations --> O(N)
for insertion --> O(1)
